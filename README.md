# Neighborhood Map

In this project, we had to create an app, in which we show our neighborhood to the curious users. My project is about my little hometown named Kédivásárhely. I chose to present my favourite places. In my opinion if you come to my tiny city these are the places which you should check out. (Of course not included the bars and coffeshops.)

# Starting the App

For starting the app, go to your terminal and run the 'npm install' command.
After installing, run the 'npm start' command and you're good to go.
Please note: you can open the project on your browser at 'localhost:3000'.

# What can you do?

By default the list of locations is shown in the sidebar. You can hide or show again this list by clicking the button on the bottom of the sidebar.
You can search by type and words in the search bar on the left corner.
If you click on a locations marker, you'll see the place's name and a link on which you can read more about the place.
